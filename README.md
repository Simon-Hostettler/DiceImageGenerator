This python file converts an image to a downscaled black and white representation, where each pixel gets replaced by a die-face closest to its darkness. 
It asks for an image input and saves the converted image as "DiceImage.jpg" in the same folder as the .py file. It also outputs a textfile "DiceArrangement.txt" with the order the dice should be placed in, in case you want to rebuild your image in real life.

Required external modules: numpy, Pillow

Example:
![Input Image](/Examples/dog.jpg)
![Output Image](/Examples/dogDiceImage.jpg)
